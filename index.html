                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>In this research, we focus on extending the research from visual object recognition to that
                            of relation inference. It permits the system to extract basic knowledge relation triplets
                            in the form of which elevates the extractable semantic of video to that of text, and
                            supports a wide range of higher level video-text fusion tasks such as the multi-perspective
                            video captioning, video QA, and multimodal knowledge graph. It also supports causal
                            reasoning, such as the counterfactual inference. In this talk, he will present the
                            background on object recognition, and present his recent works in transforming the research
                            from object recognition to video relation inference and causal reasoning. He will conclude
                            the talk by outlining several future research directions and applications. As part of this
                            research, we have constructed and released a large-scale video dataset to facilitate
                            relevant research in this emerging field. The dataset has been used for a grand challenge
                            in the ACM Multimedia 2019 conference.</p>

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>As artificial intelligence (AI) begins to impact various aspects of our lives, there is a
                            need to combine it with a better understanding of drivers of human behavior. We describe
                            our ongoing work in diverse areas, including health and information access where combining
                            AI with human factors is key to developing an effective solution. We present an AI-based
                            approach to modeling the diligence of health workers in a public health scenario, which is
                            needed to ensure that data being fed to downstream algorithms is of high quality. We
                            describe additional scenarios of "data corruption" in the context of information access
                            where the "corruption" of data is not a bug, but a feature based on natural human behavior.
                            We then present a wellness-based approach to improve health outcomes for people, which
                            requires a combination of mobile sensing, machine learning and influencing human behavior.
                            Finally, we describe a deep learning based modeling of human behavior in a specific
                            game-based setting, which has very interesting implications if we are able to generalize
                            that approach to broader settings.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>Information Extraction is the task of identifying argument-relation-argument tuples from
                            sentences. Traditional IE approaches use a pre-defined relation vocabulary, whereas Open IE
                            outputs textual relations without a given ontology. In this talk, I describe our recent
                            results on neural models for both Open IE, as well as distantly supervised relation
                            extraction. We also describe automatic data collection approaches to extend monolingual
                            (English) IE approaches to multilingual IE.

                        <p>Even though there are more than 7000 languages in the world, language technologies are
                            available only for a handful of these languages. Lack of training data poses a significant
                            challenge in developing language technologies for these languages. Recent advances in
                            Multilingual Representation Learning presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge and
                            supervision from high web-resource languages to languages with lower web-resources. In this

                            area.

                            addition, the data intelligent capability for perception, analysis and decision-making is
                            built to support adaptive abnormal detection of millions of indicators, root cause analysis

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>Computer vision for performing object segmentation in images and videos is relatively
                            routine. Therefore, when a biologist asks an AI scientists if we can use AI for segmenting
                            sub-cellular structures from optical microscopy images of living cells, one wonders what
                            has been stopping this. The answer lies in the fact that for certain sub-cellular
                            structures, the size of the structures and resolution of the microscopes are comparable.
                            Therefore, the images contain an inaccurate depiction of the reality. Manual segmentation
                            by experts who understand the morphologies of the sub-cellular structures as well as how
                            microscopes distort the morphologies is the only way out. However, manual annotation for
                            quantitative analysis in microscopy videos is a big bottleneck since it takes a few days to
                            segment all mitochondria. We solve this problem by creating a simulated expert. The
                            simulated expert simulates the diverse morphologies of the structures, the distortions
                            introduced by an optical microscope, the target segmentation, as well as the AI model for
                            segmentation. Through this simulation-supervised approach, we contribute a physic-based AI
                            solution, which then reduces the large data annotation bottleneck from several man-months
                            to a few seconds.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>For various NLP tasks, multilingual language models (mLM) were designed to provide shared
                            representations to enable transfer of task-specific supervision from high resource
                            languages to Low web-resource languages (LRLs). However, incorporating a new language in an
                            LM still remains a challenge, particularly for languages with limited corpora and in unseen
                            scripts. We show how to learn representations for LRLs by bridging the gap between related
                            languages using transliteration, dictionaries, and special alignment loss.</p>
                        <p>Another challenging low-resource setting is automatic speech recognition for accented
                            speech. We show how to adapt blackbox ASR services for mainstream accents using a
                            fine-grained splicing of the outputs of two models. We address the issue of collecting
                            labeled data for new accents using an efficient data selection algorithm.</p>

                        <p>PipeWire is the new multimedia stream sharing system. It enables applications running on a
                            device to share access to hardware devices, both audio and camera, but also to share
                            streams with each other. It replaces PulseAudio and JACK on the audio side to provide low
                            latency, low power audio service. It also enables screen sharing for Wayland compositors.
                            PipeWire also provides a security barrier where the policy control is in a separate
                            programmable demon.</p>

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>Internet of Things (IoT) allows users to connect diverse kinds of devices to accumulate
                            real-time data from the exclusive domain. The vast amount of complex data collected from
                            the IoT domain is hard to process and analyze by utilizing regular tools. Further, the data
                            in IoT are polymorphous, heterogeneous, large in quantity, and time-limited. There are also
                            some difficulties in data transmitting as well as maintaining interoperability which
                            necessitates the need for programming and statistical approaches for analyzing and managing
                            the data. This talk will explore characteristics of data in IoT, various properties/
                            requirements for processing data in IoT driven technologies, and the intent to ascertain
                            the emphases and difficulties of data processing in IoT. This talk will discuss our various
                            existing works, which utilize virtual sensing, fog computing, edge intelligence,
                            blockchain, and others to process and analyze gigantic data of IoT. The talk will also
                            discuss various types of databases used to handle IoT data and their suitability for the
                            same. Lastly, this talk will also address the security issues and the methods used to solve
                            these.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>In this talk, we will take a closer look at Autonomous Vehicles and their various
                            subsystems. We start with a bit of history and then dig into the various modules such as
                            perception, localization, prediction, planning and control that enable Autonomous Driving.
                            We will then address the enabling technologies that make a vehicle autonomous and how these
                            technologies are integrated together to allow a vehicle to navigate streets autonomously.
                            Next, we will discuss their current challenges and brainstorm how to overcome them.
                            Finally, I will talk about my current research and collaboration with industry where we are
                            working on the gesture and intent of pedestrians to infer a more detailed model of their
                            behavior so that the vehicle is able to cope with more complex scenarios in urban
                            environments. While a human driver makes constant judgments and driving decisions based on
                            perceived VRU context cues, such as intention (e.g. inferred by head and body orientation,
                            gait cycle) or explicit gestures (e.g. cyclist hand gestures), this also motivates the
                            estimation and use of such cues for future driver assistance or automated driving systems.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                        <p>Graphs are de facto data structures for many data processing applications, and their volume
                            is ever growing. Many graph processing tasks are computation intensive and/or memory
                            intensive. Therefore, we have witnessed a significant amount of effort in accelerating
                            graph processing tasks with heterogeneous architectures like GPUs, FPGAs and even ASIC. In
                            this talk, we will first review the literatures of large graph processing systems on
                            heterogeneous architectures. Next, we present our research efforts, and demonstrate the
                            significant performance impact of hardware-software co-design on designing high performance
                            graph computation systems and applications. Finally, we outline the research agenda on
                            challenges and opportunities in the system and application development of future graph
                            processing.
